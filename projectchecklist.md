Project description: 

Need motivation to study?? Is it snowing outside and you need to set the soundtrack to your life? WeatherTunes is an app that will take your zipcode look at the weather conditions outside and turn it into a playlist you can listen to. All you need to do is input your Zipcode and our app will give you the weather outlook and serve you a random playlist to go with the mood.
